Design and implementation of illegal network behavior detection technology based on machine learning

With the development of the Internet infrastructure and service facility, peopleâ€™s network life is getting 
more and more enriched. As the demand for Internet surfing continues to increase, more and more websites 
which providing various services have been established. At the same time, the malicious activities of criminals
have begun to spread further in cyberspace, and the frequency of criminal acts on the Internet is increasing. 
Various types of new malicious code are spreading on the Internet, and plenty of online frauds are emerging. 
For various types of cyber fraud, it is different from other typical internet crimes. It is easier to commit, 
so it is more widespread. Furthermore, it has formed a huge scale in number, so it is actually not feasible to
rely on human to strike the phishing. This article selects phishing websites as a typical example of online 
fraud, and uses support vector machines and random forests in machine learning to deal with them. Up to now,
the detection method flow for phishing fraud websites is relatively simple, all of which are feature extraction
and reclassification. Therefore, I chose to extract a large number of features first, and then use random forest
to filter out the better features and reduce the dimensionality of the data. Then set the data to support vector 
machine and random forest for classification. Compare and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of various
classification methods, and compare and evaluate the efficiency of some other machine algorithms.
